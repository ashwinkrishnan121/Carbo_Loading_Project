## Introduction

We all have come across Ads in weekly mailer; Starting from a new iPhone launch,
to a price slash of a household product. It is obvious that advertising
helps to reach out to people. Does this mean an increase in the product sales?
Also, if featuring in weekly mailer helps increase sales, does the location
of feature in the mailer impact sales too? **Let's analyse!!!**

We intend to analyse the trend in sales in different brands of various 
commodities over time. The data set contains household level transactions over a
period of two years from four categories: Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Syrup, and Pancake
Mix. We are planning to study how the and feature location in a weekly mailer
affects the sales of a particular commodity.

***Key variables used***:

* upc - unique product code

* brand

* commodity

* week

* feature_desc

* display_desc

* dollar_sales

* geography

* store

We plan to approch the problem by first plotting the weekly sales of different
brands for each commodity, to get insights on the impact of feature description
of the product in weekly mailer. The analysis is intended to help each brand
get an opinion on their product sales based on its location in a weekly mailer.

```

### Data Collection
We have used the Carbo-Loading dataset: A relational database provided by 84.51??
containing household level transactions of various commodities over a period of 
two years.

The dataset can be downloaded here: [Carbo Loading Dataset](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4v0mil9vls50101/AAC07lB8lhC6Auh0m0I070Eya?dl
=0)

The original dataset consists of 4 data tables in sas format. The following code
is used to import the dataset in r, after placing them in the working directory:

```{r message = FALSE, results='hide', eval = TRUE}
#import sas data

file_path <- "data/"
file_extension <- ".sas7bdat"

files_name <- c("product_lookup", "store_lookup",
                "transactions", "causal_lookup")
for (i in seq_along(files_name)) {
  file_name <- paste0(file_path,files_name[i], file_extension)
  if ( file.exists(file_name) ) {
    file <- read_sas(file_name)
    assign(paste0("df_", files_name[i]) , file)
  } else {
    print("file doesn't exist")
  }
} 
```

The tables are linked as shown below:

<img style="float: middle;" src="images/dataset.png" width=750x>

The varaibles used are described below:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
variables <- c("upc", "dollar_sales", "week", "commodity", "band",
               "feature_desc")
description <- c("Standard 10-digit Unique Product Code",
                 "Amount of dollars spent by the customers",
                  "Expresses week of the transaction. Possible values are 
                 1 through 104",
                 "Specifies 1 of 4 categories: Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Pancake mix
                 or Syrup",
                 "Specifies brand of item",
                 "Describes location of product on weekly mailer")
variable_name <- "Variable"
description_name <- "Description"
variable_table <- melt(data.frame(variables,description))
colnames(variable_table) <- c(variable_name, description_name)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
datatable(variable_table, caption = 'Variables used')
```


### Data Cleaning

```{r echo=FALSE}
upc <- df_product_lookup$upc
dollar_sales <- df_transactions$dollar_sales
```
After data collection, we need to tidy the data before exploring the same to get
insights. This involved padding of zeros to the `upc` variable, keeping only
positive `dollar_sales` values across all data sets. Then the tables are joined
using dplyr to form a single dataset. 

The code for data preparation is as below:

```{r}

#padding leading zeros to UPC to make it 10 digit
df_product_lookup$upc <- str_pad(df_product_lookup$upc, 10, pad = "0")
df_causal_lookup$upc <- str_pad(df_causal_lookup$upc, 10, pad = "0")
df_transactions$upc <- str_pad(df_transactions$upc, 10, pad = "0")

#keeping only positive dollar_sales values
df_transactions <- df_transactions[df_transactions$dollar_sales > 0,]

cleaned_data <- df_causal_lookup %>%
                inner_join(df_transactions, by = c("week", "upc", "store")) %>%
                left_join(df_product_lookup, by = "upc") %>%
                select(upc, dollar_sales, week, commodity, brand, feature_desc
                       , display_desc, store, geography.x)

```


```{r echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(head(cleaned_data, 100), caption = 'Clean Data')
```


The clean data has the following statistics:

 * We have the feature description for only weeks `r min(cleaned_data$week)` to
 `r max(cleaned_data$week)`
 
 * There are a total of `r n_distinct(cleaned_data$upc)` distinct upc, with
 `r n_distinct(cleaned_data$brand)` brands across 
 `r n_distinct(cleaned_data$commodity)` commodities.
 Each commodity has the following number of distinct brands:
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cleaned_data %>%
  group_by(commodity) %>%
  summarise(Number_of_brands = n_distinct(brand)) %>%
  datatable(caption = "Distinct brands for each commodity")
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Product sales analysis over time 

We want to see how the sales of different brands are improved by the
weekly mailer promoting the brands and if the location of the product promotion
in the store impacts sales. Before that, lets see how the net sales of each
product over the course of 2 years.

```{r, message=FALSE}

#Interactive plot of product sales vs time
sales_time_plot <- cleaned_data %>% 
  group_by(commodity, week) %>% 
  arrange(week) %>% 
  summarise(sum_sales = sum(dollar_sales)) %>% 
  filter(sum_sales < 7500) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = week, y = sum_sales, color = commodity)) +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  theme_stata() +
  ggtitle("Net Sales for each commodity") +
  xlab("Week") + ylab("Net Sales")

ggplotly(sales_time_plot)

```

We can observe that while pasta has sold well for the first year, the sales in
pasta has seen a great dip, to almost zero during the second year. Also, the
sales of syrups had seen an increase towards the end of first year, then 
following a similar dip in sales as pasta. Pasta sauce, on the other hand 
follows the exact opposite trend of syrups, as it decreases and then
the final sales increases. Pancake mixes are seen to be sold fairly well duing
the second year.

### Sales vs Geographic locations

Next, we see how the geographic location of stores affect the net sales of the 
products. From the below plot, it can be seent that the sales in location 2 
is on average high comapared to the sales of products in location 1.

```{r, message=FALSE}

#Plot to analyze sales accross difference stores and geographic locations
cleaned_data$geography.x <- as.factor(cleaned_data$geography.x)
cleaned_data %>%  
  group_by(store, geography.x ) %>% 
  summarise(sum_sales  = sum(dollar_sales)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = store, y = sum_sales, color = geography.x)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle("Net Sales for each store and store location") +
  xlab("Store") + ylab("Net Sales")

```

### Impact of Display Description

Lets analyse how the in-store display of a product impacts its sales.
The following table briefs the unique number of places where each commodity and
brand has been placed in the stores over thet course of 2 years.

```{r, message=FALSE}

#Table showing number of display desc for each brand of a product
cleaned_data %>% 
  group_by(commodity, brand) %>% 
  summarise(Number_of_Display_desc = length(unique(display_desc))) %>%
  datatable(caption = "Number of display locations for each product")

#Plot to show the average sales vs display description
cleaned_data  %>%
  group_by(display_desc) %>%
  summarise( average_sales = mean(dollar_sales)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_sales)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = display_desc, y = average_sales, fill = display_desc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("Display Description") +
  ylab("Average Sales in Dollars") +
  ggtitle("Average sales vs Disply description")
```

The plot shows the average sales with respect to display description for all the
commodities. It is seen from the plot that Side-Aisle End Cap, Secondary 
Location Display and In-Aisle Display tend to increase the sale of a product 
compared to not display it. However, we would like to see if the same trend is
followed for each commodity. Hence, we move forward to analyse the impact of 
in-store display on the average sales of each commodity, as shown below:

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Sales of each product at different Store Display Location
commodity_name <- c("pasta sauce", "syrups", "pasta", "pancake mixes")
Plots <- list()
for (i in seq_along(commodity_name)) {
  Plots[[i]] <- cleaned_data %>%
    filter(commodity == commodity_name[i]) %>%
    group_by(display_desc) %>%
    summarise(average_sales = mean(dollar_sales)) %>%
    arrange(desc(average_sales)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = display_desc, y = average_sales, fill = display_desc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    xlab("Display Description") +
    ylab("Avg Sales($)") +
    ggtitle(paste(commodity_name[i])) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)
}
p <- plot_grid(Plots[[1]], Plots[[2]], Plots[[3]], Plots[[4]])  
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("Average sales vs Store display location"
                               , fontface = 'bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))
```

Pasta Sauce has seen highest average sales when placed on Secondary
location display(ScLD), In-shelf and In-Aisle. On the other hand, Pasta has sold
well while displayed in the Side-ailse end cap (S-EC), store front and In-Aisle 
end cap. Also, pancake mixes have high sale when placed in the Mid-Aisle end cap
(M-EC) and  In-Asile display. However,it can be observed that the location
doesn't impact the sales of syrups since they surprisingly show high average
sales when Not on display (NtoD). This leads us to understand that each commodity
has different hot spots of display to boost sales.


```{r, message=FALSE}

#Sales of the brand Private Label in each store location for all products

for (i in seq_along(commodity_name)) {
  Plots[[i]] <- cleaned_data %>%
    filter(commodity == commodity_name[i], brand == "Private Label") %>%
    group_by(display_desc) %>%
    summarise(average_sales = mean(dollar_sales)) %>%
    arrange(desc(average_sales)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = display_desc, y = average_sales, fill = display_desc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    xlab("Display Description") +
    ylab("Avg Sales($)") +
    ggtitle(paste(commodity_name[i])) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)
}
p <- plot_grid(Plots[[1]], Plots[[2]], Plots[[3]], Plots[[4]])  
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label(paste("Private label sales vs Display Desc")
                               , fontface = 'bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))

```


The plot of average sales versus display description of brand 'Private Label' for
syrup commodity shows that the rear end cap, secondary location display and side
aisle end cap result in increase in sales of syrups for this brand than when
there was no display. This is contradictory to what was seen in the commodity
plot. We feel that the brand plot gives a more clearer picture than the 
commodity plot due to the reasons given above. For pasta sause the Side-Aisle
End Cap, Mid-Aisle End Cap and In-Aisle of product placements help in
improvement of sales.Comparing with the commodity plot side-aisle end cap and 
In-Aisle is seen as the choices. For Pancake mixes Mid-Aisle End Cap, Side-Aisle
End Cap and Secondary Location Display improves the sales for the product.
Comparing with the commodity plot Mid-Aisle End Cap is chosen as the location 
of display. In case of Private label pasta brand the Store-Front, Side-Aisle End
Cap helps in improvement of sales. Therefore, store front and side-aisle end
cap are chosen as possible locations for pasta commodity.

### Impact of Feature description

In the next section we want to compare whether the location of the brand of a 
commodity in the weekly mailer has an impact on the sale of the product. The 
locations in the weekly mailer are divided as back page feature, front page
feature, interior page feature, interior page line item, not on feature, wrap
back feature, wrap front feature, wrap interior feature. A plot of average sales
as a function of feature descrption is given below.

```{r, message=FALSE}

#Table showing number of feature desc for each brand of a product
cleaned_data %>% 
  group_by(commodity, brand) %>% 
  summarise(Number_of_Feature_desc = length(unique(feature_desc))) %>%
  datatable(caption = "Number of feature locations for each product")

# Overall Sales as a function of feature description
cleaned_data  %>%
  group_by(feature_desc) %>%
  summarise( average_sales = mean(dollar_sales)) %>%
  arrange(desc(average_sales)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = feature_desc, y = average_sales, fill = feature_desc)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 60, hjust = 1)) +
  xlab("Feature Description") +
  ylab("Average Sales in Dollars") +
  ggtitle("Average sales vs Feature description")
```

The interior page line item, wrap back feature and interior page feature results
in an improvement of sales. We want to analyse the commodity wise pattern and 
then a brand wise pattern of all the commodities.

```{r, message=FALSE}

# Sales of each product as a function of feature desc

for (i in seq_along(commodity_name)) {
  Plots[[i]] <- cleaned_data %>%
    filter(commodity == commodity_name[i]) %>%
    group_by(feature_desc) %>%
    summarise(average_sales = mean(dollar_sales)) %>%
    arrange(desc(average_sales)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = feature_desc, y = average_sales, fill = feature_desc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    xlab("Display Description") +
    ylab("Avg Sales($)") +
    ggtitle(paste(commodity_name[i])) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)
}
p <- plot_grid(Plots[[1]], Plots[[2]], Plots[[3]], Plots[[4]])  
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("Average sales vs Location of feature in Mailer"
                               , fontface = 'bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))

```

 For pasta commodity wrap front feature, wrap back feature and back page feature 
helps improve sales. For pancake mixes we have only four feature descriptions.
Wrap front feature helps in marginal improvement of sales. Pasta sause has all
the feature descriptions. Interior page feature has an improvement on the sales 
for this commodity. For the syrup commodity, a wrap back feature, interior page
line item and front page feature improves sales. However, as discussed for the
display description many brands in the commodity will not have a feature and the
sales plot may be affected or skewed by this. Thereofore, we are choosing a brand
(Private Label) which has  a good spread of all the feature descriptions for all
the commodities.

```{r, message=FALSE}

#Sales of the brand Private Label as a function of feature desc

for (i in seq_along(commodity_name)) {
  Plots[[i]] <- cleaned_data %>%
    filter(commodity == commodity_name[i],brand == "Private Label") %>%
    group_by(feature_desc) %>%
    summarise(average_sales = mean(dollar_sales)) %>%
    arrange(desc(average_sales)) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = feature_desc, y = average_sales, fill = feature_desc)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity",position = "dodge", show.legend = FALSE) +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) +
    xlab("Display Description") +
    ylab("Avg Sales($)") +
    ggtitle(paste(commodity_name[i])) +
    scale_x_discrete(labels = abbreviate)
}
p <- plot_grid(Plots[[1]], Plots[[2]], Plots[[3]], Plots[[4]])  
title <- ggdraw() + draw_label("Private label sales vs Weekly mailer feature"
                               , fontface = 'bold')
plot_grid(title, p, ncol = 1, rel_heights = c(0.1, 1))
```

The sales of Private Label Pasta has improved most due to the wrap front feature
,wrap back and wrap interior feature in the weekly mailer. Hence, wrap front 
feature is good spot for this product. Wrap front feature is again helping
improve sales for  Private Label pancake mixes, followed by back page feature.
The back page feature is seen improving sales of pasta sause. None of the
feature descriptions is improving the sale for syrup. Might be the syrup users 
dont read the weekly mailer. One important observation is the interior page
feature is not helping improve sales for any of the commodities and can be
avoided.

## Summary

The average sales of a commodity as a function of display and feature
description was analysed. The display description is the location of display of 
the product in the store.The feature description is the location of featuring of 
the product in the weekly mailer. The steps carried out and 
insights obtained are summarized below:

*  An initial plot of average sales as a function of display locations and 
feature description is made. 

*  A plot of average sales of the four commodities pasta, pasta sauce, 
pancake mixes and syrup versus display locations is made. An intial prediction
is made from these plots.

*  A more general conclusion is made by taking a brand 'Private Label' which 
manufactures all four commodities and is a common brand in all products, and 
also featuring in many in-store locations and magazine feature.

*  It is found that the rear end cap is the best location to display syrup. 
Side-aisle End Cap and In-Aisle are good locations to display pasta sause.
Mid-Aisle End Cap is a good location to display pancakes. Store front and 
side-aisle are chosen for pasta.

*  Wrap front feature is helping improve sales of pancake mixes and pasta.The 
back page feature is improving sales of pasta sause. The interior feature 
description is not helping improve sales. 

The customer should place the product in the store location mentioned above and 
use the weekly mailer wisely by using the above mentioned feature locations for
different commodities to improve sales. 

The limitations are many. The analysis is not exhaustive as only one brand from 
each commodity was used for the analysis. More brands for each commodity can be 
analysed and averaged to get a better picture. Effects of days of a week on 
sales can also be analysed.
